Project: Terraform Automation using Jenkins (AWS Infrastructure)
🔧 Tools & Technologies
•	AWS
•	Terraform
•	Jenkins
•	GitHub
________________________________________
🖥️ Phase 1: Steps Performed on Local Machine
These steps are executed initially to bootstrap the infrastructure.
1.	Created an S3 Bucket
o	Used as a remote backend for storing the Terraform state file (terraform.tfstate).
2.	Created AWS VPC using Terraform
o	Defined CIDR block, subnets, route tables, Internet Gateway, etc.
3.	Created EC2 Instance inside the VPC
o	EC2 instance hosts:
	Jenkins
	Terraform
o	Security groups configured for SSH (22) and Jenkins (8080).
4.	Applied Terraform Code (Initial Apply)
o	Infrastructure created without backend configuration (local state).
5.	Configured Terraform Backend
o	Added S3 backend configuration in backend.tf.
6.	Re-initialized and Applied Terraform
o	Ran terraform init -reconfigure
o	Migrated state from local to S3 backend.

⚙️ Phase 2: Steps Performed on Jenkins Server
These steps automate Terraform using Jenkins CI/CD.
1.	Installed Required Tools on Jenkins Server
o	Terraform
o	AWS CLI
o	Git
o	Java (for Jenkins)
2.	Configured Jenkins
o	Added AWS credentials (Access Key & Secret Key) /or add ec2 role to ec2 machine
o	Installed required plugins (Git, Pipeline)
3.	Created Jenkinsfile (Pipeline as Code)
o	Defined stages:
	Checkout
	Terraform Init
	Terraform Plan / Apply / Destroy
4.	Integrated GitHub Repository
o	Jenkins pulls Terraform code from GitHub using SCM.
5.	Parameterized the Jenkins Pipeline
o	Added choice parameter:
	plan
	apply
	destroy
6.	Automated Terraform Execution
o	Based on selected parameter:
	terraform plan
	terraform apply -auto-approve
	terraform destroy -auto-approve
________________________________________
🔁 End-to-End Flow
1.	Developer pushes Terraform code to GitHub
2.	Jenkins pulls the latest code
3.	Jenkins runs Terraform commands automatically
4.	Infrastructure is planned, created, or destroyed in AWS

📌 Key Highlights (For Interview)
•	Used remote backend (S3) for state management
•	Implemented parameterized Jenkins pipeline
•	Followed Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles
•	Fully automated AWS infrastructure provisioning
